## Project Summary

The project's objective is to design a user-friendly public transportation app that helps residents of Sao Paulo, Brazil, navigate their city's public transportation system seamlessly. The data used in the app will come from the GTFS data set, which is a comprehensive collection of information about the city's public transportation system, including route details, trip types, and itinerary paths. The GTFS data will provide the backbone for the app's algorithms, which we will optimize to provide accurate and efficient route options.

The app will allow users to input their starting point and destination, and based on this information, the app will calculate and display the best bus route options for the user. It will consider numerous factors, such as route length, estimated travel time, fares, and available connections. Additionally, the app will display real-time information about the buses, including their location and estimated arrival time at the selected starting point and destination. Overall, the project goal is to improve the user experience for those utilizing the public transportation system in Sao Paulo, making it easier and more efficient for them to get around the city.
